README

This repository contains a collection of C programs that demonstrate various concepts related to variables, if-else statements, and loops. Each program focuses on a specific task and is designed to fulfill certain requirements. Below is a brief description of each program and its purpose.
0-positive_or_negative.c

This program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. It then prints whether the number stored in n is positive, negative, or zero. The output format follows specific conditions based on the value of n.
1-last_digit.c

Similar to the previous program, this one also assigns a random number to the variable n with each execution. The program prints the last digit of n along with additional information, such as whether the digit is greater than 5, less than 6 (excluding 0), or equal to 0.
2-print_alphabet.c

In this program, the lowercase alphabet is printed in order using the putchar function. The code demonstrates a restriction where only the putchar function is allowed to be used, and it can be called only twice.
3-print_alphabets.c

This program prints both the lowercase and uppercase alphabets in order. The code utilizes the putchar function and follows the same restrictions as the previous program, allowing only three calls to putchar.
4-print_alphabt.c

Similar to the previous programs, this one also prints the lowercase alphabet. However, the letters 'q' and 'e' are excluded from the output. The putchar function is used twice to achieve this.
5-print_numbers.c

In this program, all single-digit numbers from 0 to 9 are printed. The code demonstrates a simple loop structure and only uses the putchar function.
6-print_numberz.c

This program is similar to the previous one but prints single-digit numbers using their ASCII values. The code emphasizes a restriction on not using variables of type char and allows only two calls to the putchar function.
7-print_tebahpla.c

In this program, the lowercase alphabet is printed in reverse order. The code follows the restrictions of using only the putchar function and making two calls to it.
8-print_base16.c

This program prints all numbers of base 16 (hexadecimal) in lowercase. The output consists of digits from 0 to 9 and letters from 'a' to 'f'. The code follows the constraints of using only the putchar function and making three calls to it.
9-print_comb.c

In this program, all possible combinations of single-digit numbers are printed. The numbers are separated by commas and spaces, and they are printed in ascending order. The code follows restrictions on using only the putchar function, allowing a maximum of four calls to it, and not using variables of type char.

Each program is individually compiled and executed to demonstrate its functionality. The required compilation commands are provided in the code comments. All the source code files can be found in the 0x01-variables_if_else_while directory of the alx-low_level_programming GitHub repository.

Feel free to explore, run, and modify these programs to enhance your understanding of variables, if-else statements, and loops in the C programming language. Happy coding!
