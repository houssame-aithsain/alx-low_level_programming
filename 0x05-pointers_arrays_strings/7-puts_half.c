/**
 * puts_half - Prints the second half of a string.
 * @str: Pointer to the string.
 *
 * Description: This function takes a string as input and prints the second
 *              half of the string. It calculates the length of the string
 *              by counting the number of characters until the null terminator.
 *              Then it determines the starting index `i` for printing the
 *              second half based on whether the length is odd or even. If the
 *              length is odd, `i` is set to len / 2, otherwise, it is set to
 *              (len - 1) / 2. Finally, it uses a loop to print the characters
 *              from index `i` until the end of the string.
