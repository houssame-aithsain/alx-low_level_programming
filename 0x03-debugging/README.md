Debugging Tasks
Task 0: Multiple mains

The task is to create a file named 0-main.c that tests the positive_or_negative() function by giving it the input of 0. The code provided can be adapted from a previous C project.

You are provided with the following files:

    main.c: The original main file that tests the positive_or_negative() function with an input of 98.
    main.h: Header file that contains the function declaration for positive_or_negative().

You need to create the following file:

    0-main.c: Test file that checks the behavior of positive_or_negative() function with an input of 0.

You should only upload 0-main.c and main.h for this task. You are not allowed to add or remove lines of code, but you can change one line in this task.
Task 1: Like, comment, subscribe

In this task, you need to copy the provided 1-main.c file and comment out the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop. You should not add or remove any lines of code, only comment out existing code.
Task 2: 0 > 972?

The code in 2-main.c file prints the largest of three integers. However, the output is not correct when the values are 972, -98, and 0. You need to fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of the three numbers, no matter the case.
Task 3: Leap year

The provided code consists of three files:

    3-main_a.c: It takes a date and prints how many days are left in the year, taking leap years into account.
    3-convert_day.c: It converts the day of the month to the day of the year, without accounting for leap year.
    3-print_remaining_days.c: It determines the remaining days in the year, taking leap years into consideration.

The code works correctly for some test cases, but it fails for the date "02/29/2000". You need to fix the print_remaining_days() function so that it works correctly for all dates and all leap years.

In all tasks, the line count will not be checked.
